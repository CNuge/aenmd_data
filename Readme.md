## aenmd_data

This repository contains R data packages for the `aenmd` package that annotates transcripts with variants that cause premature termination codons from nonsense-mediated decay. These annotations depend data structures derived from transcript models, and here we provide them for different transcript annotations for the GRCh37 and GRCh38 assemblies.
